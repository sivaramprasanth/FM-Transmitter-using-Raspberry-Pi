# FM-Transmitter-using-Raspberry-Pi

In this project I wrote a program in C to control the GPIO pins and registers in PI. I took an audio signal and transmitted it via 
FM. The carrier frequency, audio file and the bandwidth are taken as user inputs and the audio signal is modulated according to 
these inputs. To verify whether its working or not, we can open FM radio in out mobile and tune the channel to the carrier frequency and listen to the audio signal.
